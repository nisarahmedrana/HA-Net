# A Hybrid Attention Network for Accurate Breast Tumor Segmentation in Ultrasound Images

This repository provides the official implementation of the paper **“A Hybrid Attention Network for Accurate Breast Tumor Segmentation in Ultrasound Images.”**

---

## Contents
- **Model Architecture**: Implementation of the proposed Hybrid Attention Network (HA-Net) designed for accurate breast tumor segmentation in ultrasound images.  
- **Training Scripts**: Code to train the model on publicly available breast ultrasound datasets.  
- **Evaluation Scripts**: Tools to reproduce the reported performance metrics, including Dice coefficient, IoU, and sensitivity.  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Scripts for ultrasound image normalization, augmentation, and annotation handling.  
- **Pre-trained Weights (optional)**: Pre-trained models for quick reproduction of results (if permitted by dataset licensing).  
- **Documentation**: Instructions on setup, dependencies, and usage.

## Usage
The repository includes detailed instructions to replicate the experiments from the paper. Users can:

1. Prepare the dataset (links and preprocessing steps provided).  
2. Train the HA-Net model from scratch or fine-tune the pre-trained weights.  
3. Evaluate the trained model using standard segmentation metrics.
